# üöÄ About

**DebugArena** is a platform where novice software engineers and experienced professionals can connect with our community, share, and find solutions to their coding problems.

# üíª Features:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> the application has a responsive design so that it can be accessed from all devices with user-friendliness.</li>
  <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> when you first log into the application, you'll find a navigation menu that guides you to the accessible pages without user authentication and showcases the main features the 
      application offers. To start, in order for the user to fully enjoy the features offered by the application, they need to authenticate themselves. The platform provides an easy registration and login form for this 
     purpose.
  </li>
<Li><strong>Recover password:</strong> we know that people often register somewhere and then forget their passwords, which isn't very secure. However, we've thought about this, and users have the option to recover their 
    passwords if needed.
</Li>
  <li><strong>Quick access:</strong> the application provides easy access to all pages, through numerous quick links and convenient navigation.</li>
  <li><strong>Internationalization:</strong> DebugArena features internationalization, ensuring that there are no restrictions based on the user's nationality or language barrier.</li>
  <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> each user receives personalized information about their activity on posted issues, comments and average comment rating, as well as profile settings.</li>
  <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> any registered user can add an issue with their code to be discussed, add a comment to the issue and rate another user's comment, also could create an event where people from the community can gather and discuss the theme of the event.</li>
  <li><strong>Support:</strong> any user can contact us through the form available in contacts from the navigation bar.</li>
  <li><strong>Awareness:</strong> registered users receive notifications about newly created discussions on a daily basis and upcoming events for the coming week.</li>
  <li><strong>Security:</strong> all personal data of the user is well protected by Spring Security.</li>
</ul>
