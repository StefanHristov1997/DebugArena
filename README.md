# ðŸš€ About

<strong>DebugArena</strong> is a platform where novice software engineers and experienced professionals can connect with our community, share, and find solutions to their coding problems.

# Features:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> When you first log into the application, you'll find a navigation menu that guides you to the accessible pages without user authentication and showcases the main features the 
      application offers. To start, in order for the user to fully enjoy the features offered by the application, they need to authenticate themselves. The platform provides an easy registration and login form for this 
     purpose.

<Li><strong>Recover password:</strong> We know that people often register somewhere and then forget their passwords, which isn't very secure. However, we've thought about this, and users have the option to recover their 
    passwords if needed.
