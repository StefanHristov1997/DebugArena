# ðŸš€ About

<strong>DebugArena</strong> is a platform where novice software engineers and experienced professionals can connect with our community, share, and find solutions to their coding problems.

# Features:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> When you first log into the application, you'll find a navigation menu that guides you to the accessible pages without user authentication and showcases the main features the 
      application offers. To start, in order for the user to fully enjoy the features offered by the application, they need to authenticate themselves. The platform provides an easy registration and login form for this purpose.

<Li><strong>Recover password:</strong> We know that people often register somewhere and then forget their passwords, which isn't very secure. However, we've thought about this, and users have the option to recover their passwords if needed.</Li>

  <li>DebugArena features internationalization, ensuring that there are no restrictions based on the user's nationality or language barrier.</li>
  <li>The platform offers several quick links, allowing users to easily and quickly access the desired page if they already have an account or have forgotten their password.</li>
  <li>
    Once a user is registered, the application directs them to the main page, which features a quick access button to created discussions, statistics about their activity, and quick links for adding a problem, accessing 
      the user profile, and profile settings.
  </li>
  <li>From the navigation menu or the quick access link to discussions, you can find the categories in which the issues are organized, namely Java, C#, JavaScript, and Python. After selecting a category, you will find all 
     the created issues related to the specific programming language and a link to the details of each issue. There, you can add a solution to the issue as a comment and rate the comments of other users by giving them a 
      score from 1 to 5 with the corresponding number of stars.
  </li>
</ul>
