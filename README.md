  <li>To start, in order for the user to fully enjoy the features offered by the application, they need to authenticate themselves. The platform provides an easy registration form for this purpose.</li>
  <li>The platform offers several quick links, allowing users to easily and quickly access the desired page if they already have an account or have forgotten their password.</li>
  <Li>We know that people often register somewhere and then forget their passwords, which isn't very secure. However, we've thought about this, and users have the option to recover their passwords if needed.</Li>
